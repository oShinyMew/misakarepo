I'm currently working on transferring this to AWS, This still works as a repo for Misaka, however there might be some problems as the domain that i'm using ( shinymew.xyz )
will expire this month. I wont be continuing to work on the repo, i havent been working on it for a really long time but i forgot to announce it. Still, the website will work
on both AWS and GH ( hopefully )
